The kaggle data set is based on [housing prices in Ames, Iowa](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It is a modernized alternative to the well-known Boston Housing dataset. 

The Boston housing dataset contains housing prices with over 63 usable types of housing attributes. We wanted to explore the feasibility of using the attributes to predict pricing of houses using regression machine learning techniques. Before that, we require to identify the attributes with high association with housing prices. Out of the 63 attributes, 36 are numerical features and 29 are categorical features. The relationship of each attribute to pricing were ranked by applying the correlation to housing prices. 

Questions of Interest:
1. What are the top associated and non-associated features of housing attributes with the pricing of Boston houses?
2. Select and explore in plots the top associated and non-associated features of housing attributes with the pricing of Boston houses.
3. Fit a linear regression model to the training data of selected features and calculate the MSE of the model.
4. How does the model performance differ using all categorical features?
